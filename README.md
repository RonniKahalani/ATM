# ATM - Multi Team Exercise
This code as a silpe solution, for an exercise used in my computer science classes. It is a very simple solution to building an ATM interface, via a shell/terminal. 

All teams in the class have to produce a sub component, like
- Card
- Card Reader
- Money Dispenser
- Customer
- Security
- Transaction

and one team acts as the integration/devops team connecting all the component, into one main app. All code is shared via a GitHub repository, used by all the teams, using pull-requests / code reviews.
